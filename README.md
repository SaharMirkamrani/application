# Chatbot Application

## Description

To avoid reinventing the wheel and maybe contribute to open source projects a bit, I forked a repository called [React ChatBot](https://github.com/tjtanjin/react-chatbotify) and started to modify that repo to bend it towards the objectives of this task. In order to see the change of the button position, you may change the `positon` prop of the Chatbot component.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
